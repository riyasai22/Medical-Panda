Health care application powered by machine learning for pre-emptive disease prediction and cure support.

As per analysis of the existing health care systems, a doctor specialized in one field diagnoses just one disease at a time. Say, one system is used to analyse diabetes while another system analyses diabetes, and another system is used to the diagnose heart condition of a patient. When an organization wants to analyse their patient’s health reports, it's time consuming to come to a conclusion based on each individual test report. 

## Proposed Solution

Our suggested solution uses trained supervised machine learning algorithms including - SVM, KNN and Naive Bayes to a analyse diseases with one click. This doesn't replace the need of doctors but enhances the doctor's work by speeding up the time it takes to form a diagnosis and helps start patient treatment sooner. The doctor simply navigates to the particular disease and inputs the parameters based on the diagnostic tests. The corresponding machine learning model will be invoked and output the predictions on the screen.

We also have a feature that provides users the ability to predict diseases based on common symptoms to seek proactive cure in case of possible chronic disorders. The user doesn’t need to traverse different places in order to predict whether he/she has a particular disease or not.
